      question: "What is Manim AI Generator?",
      answer:
        "Manim AI Generator is an AI-powered tool that creates mathematical animations using natural language descriptions. Simply describe what you want to visualize, and our AI generates the Manim code and renders a high-quality video automatically.",
    },
    {
      question: "Do I need coding experience to use this tool?",
      answer:
        "No coding experience is required! Our AI understands natural language descriptions and generates all the necessary code for you. However, if you want to customize the generated code, our built-in editor makes it easy to make adjustments.",
    },
    {
      question: "What types of mathematical concepts can I animate?",
      answer:
        "You can animate virtually any mathematical concept including calculus, linear algebra, geometry, statistics, physics simulations, and more. Our AI is trained on a vast range of mathematical topics and can handle everything from basic arithmetic to advanced research-level mathematics.",
    },
    {
      question: "How long does it take to generate an animation?",
      answer:
        "Most animations are generated and rendered within 30 seconds. Complex animations with multiple scenes may take up to 2 minutes. The AI code generation is nearly instantaneous, with most time spent on video rendering.",
    },
    {
      question: "What video formats and qualities are supported?",
      answer:
        "We support MP4 video export in multiple resolutions: 720p (free plan), 1080p and 4K (Pro plan). You can also export as GIF for web use or download the source code for further customization.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can I edit the generated code?",
      answer:
        "Our built-in code editor allows you to modify the generated Manim code with syntax highlighting, auto-completion, and real-time preview. You can also download the code to use in your own development environment.",
    },
    {
      question: "Is there a limit to how many animations I can create?",
      answer:
        "Free users can create up to 5 animations per month. Pro users have unlimited animation generation. All plans include unlimited code generation and editing.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can I use the animations commercially?",
      answer:
        "Yes! Pro and Team plan users have full commercial rights to their generated animations. Free plan animations include a small watermark but can still be used for educational purposes.",
